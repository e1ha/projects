Plot:

```sh
ploomber plot
```

Display the pipeline:

```python
from IPython.display import Image
Image('pipeline.png')
# NOTE: ploomber plot will generate a pipeline.html (not .png) file if
# pygraphviz is missing. In such case, open the file to view the pipeline plot
```

Run the pipeline:

```sh
# run this in a terminal
ploomber build
```
